# LCVR Unity

This repository contains the necessary ingredients to create AssetBundles for the LCVR mod

## Assembly Definition

In the root of the Assets folder is an Assembly Definition called "LCVR". This Assembly Definition is required for scripts attached to Prefabs that are imported by Asset Bundles to function correctly. The name of this Assembly Definition matches exactly with the Assembly name of the LCVR mod ("LCVR"). Scripts that are added to Prefabs here must also be added to the LCVR mod for the Prefabs to be able to be instantiated.
